# SortItOut
SortItOut is a cross-platform smartphone app that uses computer vision to help individuals dispose their waste more sustainably. Users can take pictures of their waste and use SortItOut to find out which disposal bin it belongs in, as well as where the nearest disposal sites are for special items that do not belong in garbage, recycling or compost (eg - clothing donations, hazardous waste, furniture etc.). The app also contains educational resources about sustainability and the environment.
